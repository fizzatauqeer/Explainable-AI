# Explainable-AI-via-Exhaustive-Decision-Tree-Querying-on-Mental-Health-Tech-Survey-Data

This repository houses the the recreation of a Research Paper titled 'Explainable AI for Classification using Probabilistic Logic Inference' published by Fan et al. at the DeepAI Publication Conference, 2020.

1) Part 1 houses the Critical Reviews of the Assigned Papers, titled Review 1 (for Paper 1) and Review 2 (for Paper 2).

2) Part 2 houses the data, code, the Research Article explaining the Paper 
   Recreation, alongside any supplementary images embedded into the code files. 

3) You just have to navigate to these directories. As for the code, both coding aspects are in one file. You will 
   have to reset the directories where the dataset is stored on your computer, install any of the imported 
   libraries (in case they are not installed) and then run the notebook. These instructions are also present in the
   code notebook.

4) Additionally, the code and 'images' folder need to remain in one directory, as the images are embedded in the
   notebook file. The directory would for each img src may thus have to be edited to your working environment.
